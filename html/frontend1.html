  <h1>
    javascript and CSS practice
  </h1>
  <p>
    This html code is for practice with css and javascript in a browser.
    Soon links, and other kinds of experiments will be done too.
    It's self taught (note to self) so with a day job it'll take time.
    It's fun that's why I'm doing it.

  <h2>
    Purpose
  </h2>
  <p>
    In future, I intend to get into software development, some data analysis stuff.
    Generally it's the kind of programming that involves software development and data analysis.
    Yet to get into python. Told it's simpler so I'm doing javascript first.

  <h2>
    Why javascript first
  </h2>
  <p>
    For me it's for experimenting with web apps, creating chatbots, dealing with APIs and data visualization. I feel like it touches very many spheres in the tech world too, perhaps coz of it's age.
    Python comes in second in my learning coz it's much easier (as I'm told) to grasp. There are also areas that python feels for me as that added advantage like working with data across varoius devices.
